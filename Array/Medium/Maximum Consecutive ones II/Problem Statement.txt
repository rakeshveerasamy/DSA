Given a binary array, find the maximum number of consecutive 1s in this array if you can flip at most one 0.
Example 1:
	Input:  nums = [1,0,1,1,0]
	Output:  4
	
	Explanation:
	Flip the first zero will get the the maximum number of consecutive 1s.
	After flipping, the maximum number of consecutive 1s is 4.

Example 2:
	Input: nums = [1,0,1,0,1]
	Output:  3
	
	Explanation:
	Flip each zero will get the the maximum number of consecutive 1s.
	After flipping, the maximum number of consecutive 1s is 3.
