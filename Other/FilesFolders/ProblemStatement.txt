struct FilesFolders {
	vector<string> files;
	vector<string> folders;
}

FilesFolders FindAllFilesAndFolders(path) {
	// network call in google drive which fetches all files and folders inside this path.
	return FilesFolders;
}

// Implement Search method which return any path which has sub_string in it.
string Search(string path, string sub_string) {

}

Expectation: -> Implement this Search method and give time complexity according to network latency for google drive.
Solution -> A recurrence and focus on Time Complexity.

Follow up ->

New method:
void get_async(string path, callback_funcâ€¦) {
	// creates a new thread
	// Calls callback_func after 100ms or whenever operation done.
	callback_func(files, folders);
	return;
}

-> Now implement Search using new method get_async() along with time_complexities.
It was more of open ended problem and I had to ask various questions to get it cleared.

I was able to code and explain follow up but he pointed out various syntax errors.
I will share result here.
