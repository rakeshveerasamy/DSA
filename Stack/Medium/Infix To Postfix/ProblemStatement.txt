Problem statement
You are given a string 'exp' which is a valid infix expression.



Convert the given infix expression to postfix expression.



Note:
Infix notation is a method of writing mathematical expressions in which operators are placed between operands. 

For example, "3 + 4" represents the addition of 3 and 4.

Postfix notation is a method of writing mathematical expressions in which operators are placed after the operands. 

For example, "3 4 +" represents the addition of 3 and 4.

Expression contains digits, lower case English letters, ‘(’, ‘)’, ‘+’, ‘-’, ‘*’, ‘/’, ‘^’. 


Example:
Input: exp = ‘3+4*8’

Output: 348*+

Explanation:
Here multiplication is performed first and then the addition operation. Hence postfix expression is  3 4 8 * +.


Detailed explanation ( Input/output format, Notes, Images )
Sample Input 1:
3^(1+1)

Expected Answer:
311+^


Output printed on console:
311+^


Explanation of Sample Input 1:
For this testcase, we will evaluate 'b' = (1+1) first. 

Hence it's equivalent postfix expression will be "11+". 

Next we will evaluate 3^b. It's equivalent postfix expression will be "3b^". 

Replacing 'b' with it's equivalent postfix we get "311+^".


Sample Input 2:
a+b+c+d-e


Expected Answer:
ab+c+d+e-


Output printed on console:
ab+c+d+e-


Expected Time Complexity:
Try to do this in O(n).


Constraints:
1 <= 'n' <= 5000 

‘n’, is the length of EXP
The expression contains digits, lower case English letters, ‘(’, ‘)’, ‘+’, ‘-’, ‘*’, ‘/’, ‘^’. 

Time Limit: 1 sec
